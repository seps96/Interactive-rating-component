Fronted Mentor Challenge: Interactive rating component

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!

html files: index.html 

css files: app.css 

js file: index.js

Feel free to check my first Frontend Mentor Challenge and give me a feedback about my mistakes and how i could build this better.
