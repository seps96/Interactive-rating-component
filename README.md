Fronted Mentor Challenge: Interactive rating component

html files: index.html & thanksPage.html

css files: app.css & app2.css

js file: index.js

For index.html the main style is in app.css and for thanksPage.html is on app2.css

Feel free to check my first Frontend Mentor Challenge and give me a feedback about my mistakes and how i could build this better.
